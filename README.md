NIM Game
=========
Nim is a two person game in which players alternatively take “pieces” from a pile of pieces. The number of pieces in a pile may vary from game to game. On each move a player must take at least one piece and no more than a pre-agreed limit number of pieces from the pile. 

In this version of the game the loser is the player who takes the last piece.

For each game the program should be allowed to randomly select either a simple computer player or a smart computer player.
